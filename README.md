# Practicing coding with React and different technologies/frameworks/libraries

## Important Info
This repository contains different projects, each organized into separate folder, which I built as part of following the Jonas Schmedtmann React course on Udemy.

I want to clarify that I do not claim ownership of the project ideas or concepts. These projects were created for educational purposes only, following the course structure, and are intended to help me practice and learn various technologies and frameworks.

Throughout these projects, I practiced React with its some of its core concepts and advanced features

## How to Run each Project
 - Open the chosen project folder;
 - Run npm install;
 - Run npm start;
 - Only for project 15comfy-store: run npm run dev and npm run server.

## Original Course
This project is based on the course by John Smilga: [The Ultimate React Course 2024: React, Next.js, Redux & More](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/).
